# Comparative Survey of Leading Models in CARLA Simulator

The project surveys recent state-of-the-art autonomous driving models evaluated in the [CARLA](https://carla.org/) simulator, including:

- **ReasonNet** - temporal and global reasoning for rare events  
- **InterFuser** - interpretable multi-sensor fusion using CNNs and transformers  
- **TransFuser++** - simplified architecture addressing training biases  
- **TCP Framework** - hybrid of trajectory-based and control-based control  

The survey evaluates their performance on CARLA metrics (Driving Score, Route Completion, Infraction Penalty) and discusses limitations and potential improvements.

## ðŸ“„ Report

Full report: [Report.pdf](doc/Report.pdf)
## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

* **ReasonNet** achieves the highest Driving Score in CARLA but is computationally heavy.
* **InterFuser** excels at safety and interpretability through advanced sensor fusion.
* **TransFuser++** reduces training biases and complexity, but struggles with route completion.
* **TCP Framework** combines trajectory and control signals, offering balanced but less generalizable performance.
