\textbf{This report does not have any double assignment or any completed work before this semester.} This project is a comparative \textbf{survey} of leading autonomous driving models in the CARLA simulator, focusing on ReasonNet, InterFuser, TransFuser$++$, and the TCP framework. It evaluates their performance in addressing key challenges such as handling rare events, sensor fusion, training biases, and combining control-based and trajectory-based approaches. ReasonNet utilizes temporal and global reasoning for improved prediction and decision-making in urban scenarios. InterFuser enhances sensor data fusion with convolutional neural networks and transformer models. TransFuser$++$ simplifies architecture and mitigates biases, achieving high performance with fewer inputs. The TCP framework integrates both trajectory and control-based methods to optimize control signals and reduce infractions. The primary contribution of this work is that we summarize the methodology of each model, discuss their limitations, and suggest potential explanations for their performance.
