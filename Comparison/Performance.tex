In the CARLA simulator, the performance of autonomous driving models is evaluated using three crucial metrics: Driving Score, Route Completion, and Infraction Penalty\cite{carla_leaderboard}. 

\textbf{Driving score} is the main assessment indicator, combining route completion and penalties for violations. It is the multiplication of the penalty factor for the violation and the percentage of completion of the route.

\textbf{Route completion} measures the majority of allocated routes successfully completed by the automatic agent. It is expressed in percentage of the total route.

\textbf{Infraction Penalty} uses geometric sequence to punish agents for various driving violations (such as crashes or traffic violations), thereby reducing overall driving scores.

The table below shows the performance of each model \cite{paperswithcode_carla_leaderboard}.
